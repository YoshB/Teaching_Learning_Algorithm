# Teaching_Learning_Algorithm
An evolutionary algorithm based on the way we usually learn in a classroom

The teaching-learning (T_L) algorithm is an evolutionary algorithm that has not parameters to adjust, except the 
size of the population and the number of iterations, instead of other evolutionary algorithms that also have
some parameters to move the balance between exploration and explotation, but this does not mean that this 
algorithm is better or worse than others.

The algorithm is based on the way that we learn in a classrom, where we have a teacher that teaches every one,
but also the students can learn from other classmates.
